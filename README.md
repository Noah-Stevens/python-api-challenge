Module 6 Challenge

This submission features code on using information from apis to create plots, specifically scatter plots and then regressions. (WeatherPy file)

Additionally, utilizing map plots with hvplot to show on a map with an adjusted hover tooltip and narrowed selection of cities based on criteria (temperature, wind, and cloudiness).

ChatGPT was consulted on some parts of the plotting in addition to other in-class resources such as cloud recordings of the challenge being reviewed.

Thanks!
